# Two Client Chat Server
A simple chat app that allows two clients to message each other through a server. It was built for a networking class to demonstrate how sockets work in Python. To avoid the difficulty of putting the console into raw mode users take turns talking and enter a blank line to cede the microphone. The chat server shuts down once one person enters 'Bye'.

Here is how the app looks when it first boots up. The top two console windows are the chat clients and the bottom console window is the chat server.
